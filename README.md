# Breast Cancer Diagnosis with KNN Classifier

## Description

This project aims to diagnose breast cancer using a KNN classifier. It involves preprocessing the dataset, optimizing the KNN algorithm, and evaluating its performance.

## Installation

```bash
pip install --upgrade scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script.

## Workflow Overview

1. Data preprocessing: Exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, and encoding.
2. Model optimization: Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
3. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance with accuracy, precision, and F1 score.
4. Visualization: Visualizing results and comparing training/test sets.
